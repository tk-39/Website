<h1>Introduction</h1>
    
<p>I have created a site that caters for a niche group in the gaming community called "The Super Smash Brothers". I have a great interest in the video game "Super Smash bros Ultimate" for the Nintendo Switch, and i thought i would make a site that is suitable for an audience of people like myself. The website i have created offers articles, images and an image gallery that the user can navigate through which all have hyperlinks to the official nintendo site for each fighter. My motivation behind the website is to encourage users to come back frequently, since it provides news on the video game and provides helpful tips and guides. The reasoning behind my design, font family and choice of colours are because of my target audience, which is an age group of about 16-25. I chose to use a simple theme throughout the website which includes a home page, Tips/tricks guide page, character gallery, News page and an about page which tells the user what the site is about and the goals. I opted to use this theme because of its simple design and easy navigation so the user will stay on the website longer.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
    <p>I am targetting a niche community with an age group of around 16-25. My website is informative and will provide the reader with images and articles to read. My choice of colours and due to the target audience that I had in mind, which is why i used darker colours eg black and red. Most people in this age group use dark themes on most software and applications, which explains my selection of colours. Since the website is non-profit in concept, there are no stakeholders, but users can opt in to a weekly newletter.</p>
    <p>My motivation behind my website comes from my interest in the game itself and my experience as a gamer. Often when playing smash i would do research on the game to improve my gameplay, but it was often hard to find a source of information that i could easily read and navigate through. My main intention behind my site was to curve the issue that i experienced and allow users to easily access information with the simple design. Also, i had done a lot of research prior to actually making the website, and i was able to find some templates that i could follow while writing the code for my website. I also used the site "Pcgamer" as inspiration when making my site since it has a very similar target audience. I also looked at different news websites such as The Guardian and BBC when making my news page.</p>
    <h1>Planning</h1>
    <p>I used a tree structure for my website when planning. As for accessibility, I have included alt tags for every single image used on the website which will allow screen readers to read out images for those unable to see the images. My styling also provide accessibility, for example the use of a simple font family and the selection of colours. I decided to keep the background white with black text as it is the easiest to read. When putting text on top of images, i made sure to change the brightness of the image in css and make the text white so it is easily readable. Also, i made sure to use media queries so the website can be used on multiple resolutions such as mobile. As for usability, the website is very easy to navigate around. For example, the navigation user can navigate with the navigation bar, and the current page is highlighted. On the homepage, the user is prompted to go to the about page to read what the site is about before proceeding to the other content. The use of semantic tags such as "title" will show the name of the current page in the tab. Also, the  use of "a href" tags allows the user to easily navigate around the site. I also included a newsletter in the about page which allows users to keep up to date on news.</p>
    <h1>Implementation</h1>
    <p>When making the website there was a lot of things that I had to research due to my lack of experience in HTML, CSS, and JS. Being my first time using HTML and CSS, i often used w3schools as a reference for most of my code. I also watched a youtube video that helped a lot with the styling of the website. There are some things that I had copy and pasted, but most things I had either written myself or taken from online and changed them. For example, my CSS was mostly taken from the video that I will specify in the reference and then edited to fit my needs. If i were to make another site I believe I will have enough confidence to write the code on my own without the need of guidance. I also used stackoverflow when I had any questions that similar people had problems with, primarily CSS. My site does not use many resources,  but on the character gallery, they all have a hyperlink to their own profile on the official Nintendo website.</p>
    <h1>Evaluation</h1>
    <p>One thing i believe worked quite well is the navigation bar and its responsiveness. While it does not have a burger menu for the mobile resolution due to my lack of experience in JS and CSS, It is still fully responsive and so I believed it turned out well. I am also happy with the character gallery that uses some animation and all have their own hyperlink. I used code that I found online for the gallery and will cite it in the reference. Another thing that worked well is the overall design of the website. I believe it caters well for my target audience with its simplistic design and use of colourful and diverse images. As for improvement, I believe there are a lot of things I could have done better, mainly being the lack of JS. I did not include much JS for my website as it was something that I had a very hard time implementing. I was able to include a script that I found on w3schools for the slideshow but that was it. I would have also liked to make the website look a bit more aesthetically appealing, for example the lack of animations. Next time I would also like to include libraries to make the website look a lot better.</p>
